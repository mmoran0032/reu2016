Lesson 01: Introduction to Python
=================================

hello.py: print, comments, interactive vs. non-, docstrings, errors

help: google [item] python3, python.org documentation

basic math: modules, math.function, +-*/%//

variable assignments: functions, numbers and strings

EXAMPLE: planck's constant (hbar = h/2pi, h = 6.62606876e-34)

functions: definition, usage, returning values


Lesson 02: Functions and Container Types
========================================

bisection.py: refresher from yesterday, editing code, math, etc.

variables: local vs. global, naming conventions

containers: lists, tuples, strings; definition and usage

if/elif/else: conditions, <= etc


Lesson 03: File Processing
==========================

for/while: basic looping controls, work with variables/arrays

EXAMPLE: Srinivasa Ramanujan

conditions revisited

files: with statements, open/close, access types (rwa)

csv: specific case of the above


Lesson 04: Special Topics in Standard Python
============================================

strings: special cases

lists: comprehension, file processing revisited

lists as matrices: dimension, number access, processing (no math!)

try/except: basics

builtins: enumerate, zip


Lesson 05: Introduction to NumPy and Matplotlib
===============================================

EXAMPLE: array of random points

numpy: loadtxt, math operations, vectors

plotting: basic line/bar/scatter


Lesson 06: Numerical Methods
============================

integration (trapezoid, simpsons), root finding (bisection revisited), linear
algebra


Lesson 07: Numerical Methods with SciPy
=======================================

integration, root finding, linear algebra

curve fitting


Lesson 08: Final Project
========================

I give you data, you give me results
- what question do you want to answer?
- can you answer the question with the data
- what is the answer? how sure are you?
