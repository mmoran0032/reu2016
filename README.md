2016 REU Python Course
================================================================================

Files for the Python for Physicists course taught for the 2016 REU program at
Notre Dame. Based on the class from 2015 that I also led.

For presentation files, use [mdPresent](https://github.com/mmoran0032/mdPresent)
and link required presentation file as needed.

Syllabus will only compile with TeX class and style files from Mark Caprio, so I
am leaving those out and just including the compiled PDF.
