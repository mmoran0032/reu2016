\item[1] Why should you use \verb+scipy+ instead of your own functions? Why
might it be better to use your own?
\vspace{0.75in}

\item[2] Rewrite \verb+bisection.py+ to make use of \verb+scipy+.

\item[3] Think about how you would implement a curve fitting algorithm without
using \verb+scipy+, and write a rough sketch of what you would need to calculate
