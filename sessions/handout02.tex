\item[1] How many bisections do you expect to need if the tolerance is
$10^{-3}$? $10^{-6}$? $10^{-9}$? Explain your reasoning.
\vspace{0.75in}

\item[2] How (aside from actually changing the function in the code) could you
make \verb+bisection.py+ easier to use for different functions?
\vspace{0.75in}

\item[3] What are the differences between lists and tuples? Tuples and
dictionaries? Sets and dictionaries? In what cases might you use each?
\vspace{0.75in}

\item[4] Write how you think local and global variables work within functions.
\vspace{0.75in}

\item[5] How would you check within an \verb+if+ statement if a variable is a
list or not? Why would you need to do this?
