## Main Topics

1. Integration

1. Linear Algebra

1. Root Finding

1. Differential Equations

!

## Don't reinvent the wheel!

This runs counter to what we just did last class...

`scipy` has *everything* implemented already

!

## What we did previously...

Integration:

- `scipy.integrate` has the methods we need

Root finding:

- `scipy.optimize` has this (and a whole lot more!)

!

## What we can do now...

Curve fitting:

- still in `scipy.optimize`...

Linear Algebra (won't talk about today):

- `scipy.linalg` (use arrays for matrices)

And more!
