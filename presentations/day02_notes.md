02: Functions and Containers
================================================================================

Refresher from last time
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- We can define our own functions using the `def` statement

- Variables can be defined and used later, and even function can be saved as
  variables and used later (including being passed into other functions)


`bisection.py`
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Finds the root of a function via the bisection method (range of potential
  roots cut in half at every iteration)

- Take a look at the code, run it, and figure out what everything does (add in
  comments if necessary)

- What happens when you change the tolerance? How can you use different
  functions within the code?


Container types
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- python uses four basic types of containers: lists, tuples, sets, and
  dictionaries
  - We'll mostly use lists and tuples during the course, but know that the
    others are helpful in different situations

- Lists hold a group of items (numbers) in a sequence, and can be edited to add
  or subtract items from the list, or adjust items within the list

- Tuples are lists, but can't be changed after you create them
