## From last time...

!

## `bisection.py`

Available on the website

Run it with
```
$ python3 bisection.py
```

Make sure you are in the correct directory!

!

## Booleans

`True` or `False` within python

- `True` can also mean non-zero or non-empty or has-length (don't worry too
  much about this now)

- can use `and`, `or`, `not`, and group comparisons logically

!

## Controlling program flow

```
if condition is True:
    print('true')
elif condition is False:
    print('false')
else:
    print('you will never get here')
```

!

## Data Structures

lists: `l = [1, 2, 3]

tuples: `t = (1, 2, 3)

sets: `s = set([1, 2, 3])

dictionary: `d = {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3}

!

## Introduction to Strings

Strings are everywhere!

You've already worked with some before...

`strip, split, float`
