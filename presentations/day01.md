## Math Operations

```
+ - * ** / // %

import math
math.cos(math.pi)
```

!

## Functions

```
print('Hello, world!')
print(5**3)
len('physics')
```

!

## Variables

```
name = 'Mike'
print(name)
full_name = name + ' Moran'
print('My full name is', full_name)
```

## Tired of typing?

We can create a program that we can just run, instead of typing everything in
over and over again.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

# code goes here
print(5**2)
```

!

## Your own functions

```
def square_it(number):
    return number**2
```
